# Mobile App Pen Test Guide
Mobile App Pen Test guide provides a quick overview of various tools and techniques used to perform penetration testing on mobile apps


### OWASP Top 10 
No Pen Test guide can start witout mention of Mobile OWASP Top 10 https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-top-10/

OWASP Mobile Top 10 is a list that identifies types of security risks faced by mobile apps globally. This list, which was last updated in 2016, is an acting guide for developers to build secure applications and incorporate best coding practices. With almost 85 percent of apps tested by NowSecure found to be affected by at least one of the OWASP Top 10 risks, it becomes essential for developers to understand each one of them and adopt coding practices that nullify their occurrence as far as possible. 

### All-in-one Security Tools
* [Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF) An all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing, malware analysis and security assessment framework capable of performing static and dynamic analysis, that can work directly on mobile app binaries (APK, XAPK, IPA & APPX) along with zipped source code and provides REST APIs for seamless integration with your CI/CD or DevSecOps pipeline. The Dynamic Analyzer helps you to perform runtime security assessment and interactive instrumented testing.
